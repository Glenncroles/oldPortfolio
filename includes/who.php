          <p>Hello! My name is Trevor Booth, I am currently in school at Francis Tuttle working towards my major of Web Design &amp; Development.  I grew up in a fairly small town outside of Oklahoma City; I moved here from Memphis, Tennessee when I was about 12 years old. I graduated High School at 17, from there I attend South Western Oklahoma State University for 1 year. After, I packed my bags and moved to OKC where I attended Oklahoma City Community College for a few semesters, trying some different classes and seeing what I liked. I struggled for a couple of years trying to decide what I wanted to do. When you're just a kid picking something that you could perchance be doing for the rest of your time seems pretty scary. So, I went with the Tech Industry! I have an endless list of possibilities I could potentially embrace. Computers aren't going anywhere any time soon and if they do, my career choices will be the least of my worries. I made the move to Francis Tuttle to save money on tuition and you get to work just as you would in the job. I love the work I am doing here and I am ready to test myself and start a career. </p> 
          <p> My skills range from HTML, CSS, SQL, JS, PHP, and some Photoshop. This page will have everything you need to <a class="smoothScroll" href="#skills">contact</a> me or you can check out some of my previous work on my
